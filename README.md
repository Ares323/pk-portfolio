## 🧠 Concept

Traditional portfolios are static.  
This project explores **calm interaction**, **ambient motion**, and **visual storytelling**
to create a portfolio that feels *alive* — not just viewed, but experienced.

The aquarium runs continuously in the background while content floats peacefully above it.
